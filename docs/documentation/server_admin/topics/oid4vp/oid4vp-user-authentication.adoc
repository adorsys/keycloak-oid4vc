== Authenticate users with verifiable credentials over OpenID4VP

{project_name} implements experimental support for authenticating users as they present verifiable credentials issued to them by itself.
This is done over https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-presentations-1_0-20.html[OpenID for Verifiable Presentation (OpenID4VP)].
This chapter describes how to interact with this feature.

[IMPORTANT]
====
This is an experimental feature and should not be used in production.
Backward compatibility is not guaranteed, and future updates may introduce breaking changes.

=== What is covered in this chapter

- Enabling user authentication over OpenID4VP
- Initiating the flow by retrieving an authentication request
- Polling for the status of the authentication session

=== Enabling user authentication over OpenID4VP

To enable user authentication over OpenID4VP, make sure to add the following flags to the startup command:

[source,bash]
----
--features=oid4vc-vpauth,oid4vc-vci
----

Verify activation by checking the server logs.
The second `oid4vc-vci` feature must equally be activated because the feature relies on {project_name} being able to link:../oid4vci/vc-issuer-configuration.adoc[issue verifiable credentials] to users itself.

=== Initiating the flow by retrieving an authentication request

To retrieve an authentication request, send a POST request to the `/oid4vp-auth/request` endpoint.
The request must be sent form-urlencoded and embed credentials for client authentication.

[source,bash]
----
POST /realms/<realm>/oid4vp-auth/request
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
client_id=<client_id>&client_secret=<client_secret>
----

The endpoint returns an object containing:

* an OpenID4VP authorization request link that can be used to initiate the authentication flow, either directly or by generating a QR code from it;
* a transaction ID for inquiring the status of the thereby opened authentication session.

[source,json]
----
{
  "authorization_request": "openid4vp://?client_id=<client_id>&request_uri=<request_uri>",
  "transaction_id": "<transaction_id>"
}
----

=== Polling for the status of the authentication session

Because the OpenID4VP authentication flow is implied to be pursued cross-device, the initiating client needs to asynchronously check the status of the authentication session.
For this, send a GET request to the `/oid4vp-auth/status` endpoint, passing the transaction ID received in the previous step.

[source,bash]
----
GET /realms/<realm>/oid4vp-auth/status/<transaction_id>
----

The response is an object containing the status of the authentication session, which can be one of the following: `pending`, `success`, or `error`.
In case of a successful authentication, the response also contains an *authorization code* to exchange for an access token.
In case of an error, the response contains error details.

.Pending authentication
[source,json]
----
{
  "status": "pending"
}
----

.Successful authentication
[source,json]
----
{
  "status": "success",
  "authorization_code": "<code>"
}
----

.Error during authentication
[source,json]
----
{
  "status": "error",
  "error": "<error_type>",
  "error_description": "<error_description>"
}
----
